Background
Cyclistic is a bike-sharing service in Chicago, offering over 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations. It provides various bike types for riders with disabilities. Cyclistic's marketing has typically targeted a broad consumer base, offering single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. The goal of this project is to develop strategies to convert casual riders (those with single-ride or full-day passes) into annual members.

My Role
As a junior data analyst, my task is to analyze usage patterns and create marketing strategies to encourage casual riders to become annual members.

Business Question
How do the usage patterns of annual members and casual riders differ on Cyclistic bikes?
